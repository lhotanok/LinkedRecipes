Collection of 3 recipes datasets

Dataset generated from: https://apify.com/dtrungtin/allrecipes-scraper

I included dataset files directly in the source directory as I had to edit them before use.
I only extracted each 10th recipe from Kaggle dataset to reduce the file size (which was originally over 200 MB).
